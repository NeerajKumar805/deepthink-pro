## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* Java 17+
* Maven
* Spring Boot
* Git
* Ollama CLI (for Qwen models)

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NeerajKumar805/deepthink-pro.git
   cd deepthink-pro
   ```

2. **Install and configure Ollama models**

   * Download and install Ollama from the official site.
   * Pull the required Qwen models:

    I'm mentioning the models that I've used in this project:

     ```bash
     ollama pull qwen2.5:1.5b
     ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
     ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
     ```

3. **Build and run the backend**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The backend starts on `http://localhost:9990` (adjust port in `application.properties` if needed).

4. **Integrate the frontend**

   * Place your compiled frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) into `src/main/resources/static`.

5. **Test the API**

   * Use Postman or Swagger UI (`http://localhost:9990/swagger-ui.html`) to verify endpoints.

## Usage

* Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9990`.
* Interact with Deepthink-Pro through the chat window to access features.
